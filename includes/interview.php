                        In our country today, when it comes to the state of development, many
                        people have the same opinion; "the government is to blame!". Whether this is
                        true or not, the question is; have you earned the right to blame the government?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neighbourhood Stalker heard about something interesting happening this
                        weekend and we found out it was about
                        restructuring minds and channelling potentials. Trust us to have hunted down
                        the culprit behind this lol. We stalked him on Whatsapp and got this exclusive
                        interview. Grab a coke, some popcorn and enjoy every bit of it. Don't thank
                        us. We've got your bank ;)

                    <h3>WHICH ONE IS LTA AGAIN?</h3>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:03] STALKER!: So from what we know.. #MakeItHappen is brought to us by LTA.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:04] STALKER!: Which you run. So let's start from there. Please tell us about LTA.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:22] Michael LOS: Aite</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:22] Michael LOS: LTA is an acronym for Life Transformers Academy</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:23] Michael LOS: We are a complimentary center for youth development</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:23] Michael LOS: Where we focus on the mindset of people (young people).</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:24] Michael LOS: We believe that until a man is transformed from the mind... Nothing else can Change.</p>
                    <h3>»WHO LTA DON HELP?</h3>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:25] Michael LOS: So, since 2013, we have been engaging Youths in activities to help unlock their minds so they can become WHO & WHAT they were created to be.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:26] Michael LOS: Make It Happen... Is one vehicle we are using to make this dream a reality. Thanks.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:26] STALKER!: Wow. Great.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:27] STALKER!: I'm very excited that things like these are happening right here in one of our hoods</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:27] STALKER!: I would like you to tell us, why the emphasis on young people?</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:29] Michael LOS: Its easier to bend a rod when it is HOT!</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:29] Michael LOS: We are the HOT generation</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:30] Michael LOS: Fresh Ideas, Fresh Excitement! Fresh Possibilities!</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:31] Michael LOS: We are more open to new innovations and opportunities because we are DOERS</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:32] Michael LOS: Our parents are great and experienced... However, experience unchecked can cage a man. So, a past failure makes an individual skeptical if not afraid of starting again</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:33] Michael LOS: ... Youths... Have no fear, no hindrance, no limitation... Just the dream and hope of accomplishing great things.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:33] Michael LOS: This is Why We focus primarily on Youths</p>

                    <p>[7/29, 09:34] STALKER!: It's ironical then, how many young people feel like they have to wait till they're older.</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:35] Michael LOS: Yeaaa... There's actually... No Time!</p>
                    <p>[7/29, 09:36] Michael LOS: If our Youths should go to Asian countries like China, Japan or Korea... They will be embarrassed at how much knowledge Children and Teenagers posses.</p>
